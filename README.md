Beginning Neural Networks

For the convolutional neural networks, download the dogs vs cats dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data and download the vgg16 model from https://www.kaggle.com/keras/vgg16?select=vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5.

I am following the keras tutorial on deeplizard.com, so give them so love and check it out here, https://deeplizard.com/learn/playlist/PLZbbT5o_s2xrwRnXk_yCPtnqqo4_u2YGL.
